# Mathematical Statistics Projects

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks created as part of the **Mathematical Statistics** course. The projects were developed in a group of four students and cover key concepts and methods in mathematical statistics. Below is an overview of the topics explored:

## Contents
1. **Discrete and Continuous Random Variables**  
   Analysis and properties of random variables, including probability distributions and key statistical measures.

2. **Multidimensional Random Variables**  
   Joint distributions, marginal distributions, and covariance for multidimensional random variables.

3. **Elements of Exploratory Data Analysis**  
   Techniques for summarizing and visualizing data to understand underlying patterns and distributions.

4. **Random Sampling**  
   Methods for drawing random samples and understanding their statistical properties.

5. **Parametric Estimation**  
   Estimation of parameters using methods such as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE).

6. **Non-Parametric Estimation**  
   Statistical estimation without assuming a specific probability distribution.

7. **Bootstrap Estimation**  
   Resampling techniques for estimating the sampling distribution of a statistic.

8. **Parametric Tests**  
   Hypothesis testing using parametric methods, including t-tests and z-tests.

9. **Non-Parametric Tests**  
   Hypothesis testing methods that do not rely on specific distribution assumptions.

10. **Bootstrap and Permutation Tests**  
    Advanced resampling methods for hypothesis testing and inference.

11. **Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's HSD**  
    Techniques for comparing means across multiple groups and performing post-hoc analysis.

## Notes
- The notebooks demonstrate theoretical foundations, practical implementations, and illustrative examples.
- These projects reflect collaborative work and learning efforts during the course. While they aim to showcase statistical methods, some areas might not follow best practices in real-world applications.

Feel free to explore the repository for educational purposes or as a reference for statistical methods.
